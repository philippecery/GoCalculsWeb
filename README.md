# maths

A web application for kids to practice mental math and column form operations in arithmetics.

Initially developed in Python / Flask - meant to be deployed on my old Synology NAS - in 2017, only for my kids, I'm now porting it to Go with user management and other additional features, to make it easier for parents to install it on any personal computer.
